# gw2predict
A simple ML implementation to predict future prices based on historical price data.

An observation of the historical prices vs prices after a 30 days shows a linear pattern. for the sake of learning I made this script which pull the historical price data from silver's API and apply 4 different regression models ( Linear , Lasso , Ridge and Elastic Net). Accuracy is printed and its pretty similer accross the 4 types so I decided to use Linear only.

I am in no means an expert. This tool is made for an educational purpose and you can not rely on it to decide your invesments.
